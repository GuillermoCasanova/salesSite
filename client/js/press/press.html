            SALES is the collaboration between Florida natives Lauren Morgan and Jordan Shih. Since the release of their first single, “renee,” the duo have operated within a collective partnership (inauspiciously titled SALES MEDIA LLC) with friends and fellow collaborators Alana Questell (artist) and Guillermo Casanova (designer).

            SALES (the band) consists of two people sitting in an apartment bedroom working on pop songs by moonlight. Their long-awaited debut album, SALES LP, will be released on April 20th, 2016. A respite from their day jobs, the forthcoming SALES LP was completely written, recorded, and produced in an untreated bedroom studio. The sound the duo has created is minimal, yet emotive and incisive. The album is an homage to their limitations with time, equipment, money, and space. These are songs made of blood, sweat, and Chinese take-out. The album was created under the ideology that you should make the music you want to hear.

            The duo heavily relies on experimentation within their process, whether it is switching lead guitarists, moving over to let someone else hold the mouse, recording vocals through Apple headphones (rather than the stellar SM7B), or inserting a 404 into a ballad. Each track humbly explores new territory with every song, as SALES moves to better understand and refine their “AS IS” approach to music.

            Strutting into 2016, the duo continues to steadily cultivate a cultish following. After self-releasing their eponymous debut EP in 2014, they were named “Ones to Watch” by Hype Machine + BBC 6. Since 2014, they have headlined tours in the US, Canada, and Europe, playing sold out shows in major cities including New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The SALES EP, with only 5 songs, has over 2 million streams on Soundcloud and 5 million streams on Spotify.

            Their main influences are Kanye West, Hanson, Kevin Parker, Bruce Dickinson, Macklemore, Smash Mouth, and Beach House. They are self-managed and fully independent, with SALES’ collective partnership serving as their label (SALES MEDIA LLC). Between tennis matches, dead-end jobs, and Thai lunch specials they have continued to release music that has gained the attention of publications such as Pigeons & Planes, Stereogum, and Gorilla Vs. Bear.

                The addition of the SALES LP to their tiny repertoire is only the beginning of an ever-expanding sound, and a small step in a new approach to music: empowered by the digital listening experience, and completely independent of a record label.
