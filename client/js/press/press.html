The collaboration between Florida natives, Lauren Morgan and Jordan Shih, has been pumping out earworms since their first single, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://soundcloud.com/sales/sales-renee&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1473969539980000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEqUl13OXdqvHg85ShmoMFHBMI_ng">renee</a>,&rdquo; in 2013. The duo self-released their debut <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://soundcloud.com/sales/sets/sales-ep&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1473969539981000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGPT5SONPsnswCaS33lSw2Zkzbomw">EP</a>&nbsp;in 2014, and were named &ldquo;Ones to Watch&rdquo; by Hype Machine + BBC 6. They have headlined tours in the US, Canada and Europe with sold out shows in major cities such as LA, SF, SD and Brooklyn.&nbsp;Since the release of their debut LP on April 20th, 2016, they have reached over 4.5 million streams on SoundCloud&nbsp;and 15 million streams on Spotify. </p>
        <p>They are self-managed and fully independent, with SALES&rsquo; collective partnership serving as their label (SALES MEDIA LLC). Between tennis matches, dead-end jobs, and Thai lunch specials, they have continued to release music that has gained the attention of publications such as Pigeons &amp; Planes, Stereogum, Pitchfork and Gorilla Vs. Bear. </p>
        <p>The duo heavily relies on experimentation within their process, whether it is switching lead guitarists, moving over to let someone else hold the mouse, recording vocals through Apple headphones (rather than the&nbsp;stellar SM7B), or inserting a 404 into a ballad.&nbsp;Each track humbly explores new territory with every song, as SALES moves to better understand and refine their &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; approach to music. </p>

            The duo heavily relies on experimentation within their process, whether it is switching lead guitarists, moving over to let someone else hold the mouse, recording vocals through Apple headphones (rather than the stellar SM7B), or inserting a 404 into a ballad. Each track humbly explores new territory with every song, as SALES moves to better understand and refine their “AS IS” approach to music.

            Strutting into 2016, the duo continues to steadily cultivate a cultish following. After self-releasing their eponymous debut EP in 2014, they were named “Ones to Watch” by Hype Machine + BBC 6. Since 2014, they have headlined tours in the US, Canada, and Europe, playing sold out shows in major cities including New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. The SALES EP, with only 5 songs, has over 2 million streams on Soundcloud and 5 million streams on Spotify.

            <p>
            Their main influences are Kanye West, Hanson, Kevin Parker, Bruce Dickinson, Macklemore, Smash Mouth, and Beach House. They are self-managed and fully independent, with SALES’ collective partnership serving as their label (SALES MEDIA LLC). Between tennis matches, dead-end jobs, and Thai lunch specials they have continued to release music that has gained the attention of publications such as Pigeons & Planes, Stereogum, and Gorilla Vs. Bear.

                The addition of the SALES LP to their tiny repertoire is only the beginning of an ever-expanding sound, and a small step in a new approach to music: empowered by the digital listening experience, and completely independent of a record label.

            The SALES LP was completely written, recorded, and produced in an un-treated bedroom studio. The album was created under the ideology that you should make the music you want to hear. The addition of the SALES LP to their tiny repertoire is only the beginning of an ever-expanding sound, and a small step in a new approach to music: empowered by the digital listening experience, and completely independent of a record label.</p>
