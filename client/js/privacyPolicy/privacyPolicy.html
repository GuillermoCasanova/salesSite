                <h1 class="fwb">OUR Privacy Policy</h1>

                <p>
                SALES (SALES MEDIA LLC) collects information from our users at several different points on our website. SALES (SALES MEDIA LLC) is the sole 

                owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell or rent this information to others. We will 

                only share this information with our affiliates and marketing partners contracted to do business on our 

                behalf.

                SALES (SALES MEDIA LLC) uses two types of user information: anonymous information gathered from cookies and log files, and 

                personal information you provide us for certain services. See below for definitions of each of these 

                methods.</p>

                <h2 class="fwb">Anonymous Information – Cookies and Log Files</h2>

                <p>
                A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a 

                cookie is in no way linked to personal information, until a user provides that information (see below). If a 

                user rejects or deletes the cookie, he/she may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user 

                will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to receive notification of 

                special offers, or participate in any contests that may take place. Cookies also enable us to track and 

                aggregate clickstream behavior data. By doing this we can better target the interests of our users and 

                enhance their experience on our site. SALES (SALES MEDIA LLC) also maintains standard web logs that record data about all 

                visitors to this Web site. These logs may contain:</p>


                <ul>
                    
                    <li>The Internet domain from which you access this site.</li>
                    
                    <li>Your IP address (Your computer is automatically assigned an IP address when you surf the Internet. Your IP address is either static or dynamic. A static IP address may be identifiable to you; a dynamic address is usually not identifiable to you).</li>

                    <li>The type of browser and operating system you use.</li>
                    <li>The date and time you visited this site.</li>
                    <li>The pages you viewed on this site.</li>
                    <li>The address of the website from which you linked.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                SALES (SALES MEDIA LLC) uses web log and clickstream information to help us design our site, to identify popular site features 

                and to make the site more useful for visitors. Web logs are recorded in sequential files, and we normally do 

                not attempt to identify individuals from these logs. However, we may use web logs to identify persons 

                attempting to break into, disrupt, or damage our Site. We may share web log information with law 

                enforcement personnel if we believe evidence exists, or is likely to occur, of a violation of federal, state or 

                local laws or regulations.</p>



                <h2 class="fwb">Volunteering Personal Information</h2>

                <p>Users may choose to volunteer personal information (name, e-mail address, phone number, etc.) in order 
                    
                    for us to provide them with services such as brochure and information requests, surveys and contests, site 
                    
                    announcements, and special offers at the time of the request or in the future. If you previously gave us your 
                    
                    e-mail address and no longer wish to receive e-mail announcements, you can have your name removed 
                    
                    from our e-mail list by sending an e-mail to info@drinkSALES (SALES MEDIA LLC).com, calling, or by sending regular mail (see 
                    
                    contact information below). SALES (SALES MEDIA LLC) does not sell or rent user information to any third parties. We share user 
                    
                    information with our affiliates and marketing partners contracted to do business on our behalf. When the 
                    
                    user signs up for certain services and offers on our site, we will share names, or other contact information 
                    
                    necessary for any associated third party to provide these services. SALES (SALES MEDIA LLC) will share user information in 
                    
                    accordance with the privacy policy in effect at the time the information is collected. If a user’s personal 
                    
                    information changes, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct or update that user’s personal data 
                    
                    provided to us. This can be done by e-mailing info@drinkSALES (SALES MEDIA LLC).com or by contacting SALES (SALES MEDIA LLC) as outlined 
                    
                    below.
                </p>

                <h2 class="fwb">Security</h2>

            <p>SALES (SALES MEDIA LLC) takes all reasonable precautions to protect our users’ information, both while the information is 
                
                being transmitted and after it is received by us. If this website is hosted on a Secure Server, when users are 
                
                asked to enter sensitive information (such as social security number), that information is encrypted and is 
                
                protected with SSL 128-bit encryption software, an industry standard for reputable organizations. While on 
                
                a secure page, such as a credit pre-approval application form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers 
                
                such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or 
                
                open. Furthermore, once the information has been received by us, we use security procedures and policies 
                
                that commensurate with industry standards to safeguard against loss, theft, unauthorized access, 
                
                destruction, use, modification and disclosure. If you have any questions about the security of our website, 
                
                you can send an e-mail to info@drinkSALES (SALES MEDIA LLC).com.</p>


                <h2 class="fwb">Notification of Changes</h2>

                <p>SALES (SALES MEDIA LLC) retains the right to change this privacy policy at any time. We will post those changes to this page so 

                that users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances 

                we disclose it. We will use, share, and disclose all information in accordance with the privacy policy in 

                effect at the time the information was collected.</p>



                <h2 class="fwb">Certain Disclosures</h2>

                <p>SALES (SALES MEDIA LLC) may disclose any data, whether personally identifiable or not, to any person performing audit, legal, 
                    
                    operational or other similar services for SALES (SALES MEDIA LLC). Whenever possible, we will require any recipient of 
                    
                    personal information for these purposes to agree in writing to hold the information in confidence, to use the 
                    
                    information only for the permitted purpose, and to return or destroy the information when the services are 
                    
                    completed. We may also disclose any data, whether personally identifiable or not, when required to do so

                    such disclosure will or has occurred. We may also disclose any data, whether personally identifiable or not, 
                    
                    when we reasonably deem it necessary to protect the safety of (i) an individual, (ii) the public, or (iii) the
